A new Flutter project.

## How To Test

Create a new Flutter project in IntelliJ IDEA.
Replace the main.dart file in the newly created project with the main.dart file in this repository.
Replace the pubspec.yaml file in your project with the pubspec.yaml from this repository.
Download the images folder from this repository, and add it to your project directory.
Run using your chosen emulator.

*Note: this repository contains everything from my Flutter project in IntelliJ IDEA CE. I have it set up for iPhone, and I don't know if it would work with Android as well.
